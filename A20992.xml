            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>A Prince being reſolved to make warre (be it offenſive or defenſive) ought to make ſuch proviſion of men, inſtruments, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and victuall, as he ſhall know to be neceſſary for his enterpriſe.</p>
                  <p>In making his proviſion of men, he is to chooſe ſuch as are fit for counſell, for command, and for ſouldierie.</p>
                  <p>For his counſels, ſuch whoſe age, prudence, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and ſtudy renders capable of ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments.</p>
                  <p>For commanders in his armies, he is to chooſe men of authoritie, reſpect, prudence, experience, and good fortune. Each of them having made ſuch proof of their courage, ſufficiencie, and good ſucceſſe in their ſeverall charges, as it be appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently known to all men; chiefly chooſing ſuch as are born courageous, and are habituated in all the exerciſes of warre: as, to handle all ſorts of armes, to know all manner of militarie motions, to form all ſorts of battaillons, to range armies in battalia, to make them march, encamp, embat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, to erect fortifications, to aſſault places of ſtrength, and to defend them, to make the trenches, and place the batteries; briefly, that they know all the functions of warre.</p>

                  <p>For ſouldiers (whether they be Infanterie or Cavallrie) they ought to be elected, ſuch as are ſtrong, ſtout, and of fitting yeares, giving them ſuch armes as are moſt fitting for them; and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plining them.</p>
                  <p>For the politick part, that they be ſober and continent in their ſuſtenance, abſtemious from play and women, modeſt in their ſpeeches, appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, and all other actions.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the militarie part, they are to be inſtructed in the uſe and exerciſe of the ſword, musket, and pike; and to be taught how to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp, entrench, and make their huts, how to keep themſelves in order, and to be expert in all moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons requiſite for the forming and ready dividing of ſuch forms as ſhall be deſired. To this end the Captains, Lieutenants, and Enſignes ought to be very carefull to inſtruct and diſcipline their ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</p>
                  <p>The militarie diſcipline for the foot is this; The musketiers ought to be exact in the uſe of their musket and reſt together, to ſhoulder pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, to make ready, and preſent all after one and the ſame manner, whether it be upon entring into the guard, to paſſe a muſter, or to go to the charge; To give fire, either by themſelves, by files, by ranks, or in a volly. The pikes to ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der (aſloap and levell) advance, trail, charge to front and rear; And both pikes and muskets, how to wear their ſwords, how to keep their ranks and files, to take their diſtances, both for muſter and fight; To uſe their motions, to the right, left, and rear; To double, open, cloſe, and to reduce both files and ranks; to countermarch, and wheel.</p>

                  <head>Of embattailing the Armie. <hi>CHAP. III.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THere be two kindes of occaſions of giving battaile; the one is particular, hapning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſmall troops, as encounters which (for the moſt part) are given by accident, and ſometimes upon deliberation; alſo ſuch skirmiſhes as are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily uſed to draw out, entertain, or diſcover the enemie.</p>
                  <p>The other is generall, as when one Armie coming to encounter the other, they give Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile; wherein for the diverſities of times before the combat, during it, and after it, there muſt be had divers conſiderations. Before the combat, you muſt know the enemies forces, both horſe and foot, as alſo his Artillerie and Munitions; you muſt alſo know whereunto he chiefly truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, in what order he uſeth to fight, alſo the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and paſſages of the countrey. You muſt make diligent diſcoverie of his deſignes and actions by your own ſpies, or the enemies, being corrupted with money or promiſes.</p>
                  <p>You muſt attempt to divide his forces, to raiſe jealouſies and diffidences between his chiefs, or between them and their officers, to incite his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to mutinie.</p>
                  <p>You muſt ſtrive to ſeize upon the moſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous ground to range the Armie into Battalia,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:23136:19"/> having regard to the winde to avoid the duſt and ſmoak, and to drive it into their eyes; and to the ſunne, that you be not dazled: directing your ſelf according to the place, and the number of your own and the enemies forces.</p>
                  <p>The ſouldiers muſt be deprived of all hope of ſaving themſelves by flight, and muſt be brought to a diſpoſition to fight courageouſly; propounding to them the glorie, the bootie, the recompenſe, and the neceſſitie.</p>
                  <p>The order which muſt be obſerved in ranging the Armie for<note n="a" place="margin">In my book of Cavallrie (before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) you may ſee divers formes of battaile in figure <hi>8, 9, 10,</hi> &amp;c.</note> combat hath been ſhewed in the firſt chapter, being the ſame as the march in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talia.</p>
                  <p>The Artillerie muſt play ſo ſoon as they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to diſcover the battaillons of the enemie, making the batterie fitly and ſpeedily, to diſorder and ſcatter them before they come to give bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile.</p>
                  <p>Whileſt the Armie ſtands ranged in battalia, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the ſignall for combat, the Marſhalls of the field ought to ride before the Van, to cauſe them to advance when the fight ſhall begin, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Generalls order, and to command the battaillons to joyne and charge the enemie, or to receive his charge according to occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences.</p>
                  <p>The Generall of the Armie by his dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence ought to be as the ſoul in the body throughout all the members; alwayes obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the countenance of the enemie, to make his men fight to purpoſe; aſſiſting the broken battaillons by freſh ones, or by ſquadrons, and ordering thoſe which (having been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded) ſhall rally again, to ſend them to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:23136:20"/> the combat to releeve their fellows. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch as have been beaten will hardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to fight again, you muſt not truſt too much to them.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as you be within reach of the Canon, you muſt go on directly upon the enemie, (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe you be ſheltered from his Artillerie) by this means your ſouldiers are encouraged, you avoid the danger of the enemies Canon, and you leave behinde you the place where your Armie ſtood ranged, which ground will ſerve to rally and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Battaillons which ſhall happen to be routed. You muſt not give on ſo haſtily, as that thereby the Battaillons be diſordered; and on the other-ſide you are to uſe a marching pace un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till you come within diſtance of a Piſtoll-ſhot, but then to double your pace and to charge furiouſly, the Pikes being cloſe ſerried, and the Muskets continually playing on the Flanks, having certain Targetteers in Front which may ſhelter the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taillon, and diſorder the enemies Pikes.</p>
                  <p>You muſt give a ſufficient Front to the Battail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons, that ſo they may overwing the enemie, and charge him in Front and Flank, obſerving on which part the enemie giveth the moſt violent aſſault, and thither to ſend the troops of Reſerve; as alſo, where he is weakeſt, that there he may be the more eaſily routed; diſſembling and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing all ſiniſter accidents; and whatſoever proves proſperous, to cauſe that to be publiſhed aloud, for the raiſing of their ſpirits which happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly might be become heartleſſe, either by over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much labour, or by the rumour of ſome diſaſter; propounding to them the faintneſſe of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, the death of his Commanders, the ſlight of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:23136:20"/> his troops, the ſpoil, the honour of the victorie, and the great bootie; Sending the orders and commands by Officers and perſons known, and not from hand to hand by <hi>paſſe parolle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After the combat, either you are vanquiſher or vanquiſhed: If you be vanquiſher, and have no cauſe to feare the enemie any more, as being not able to rally himſelf, either you content your ſelf with the victorie, or you attempt farther to conquer.</p>
                  <p>If you reſt content with this victorie, God is ſolemnly to be praiſed, the ſouldiers are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, commended, and recompenced, principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Chiefs and ſuch as have performed any ſignall acts, ſharing out the ſpoil amongſt them according to their merits, giving order that the priſoners be truſtily kept and courteouſly uſed, cauſing the hurt to be carefully cured and the dead buried.</p>
                  <p>If you attempt to conquer the enemies coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, you are to publiſh the victorie, for that will cauſe his confederates to ſhrink from their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance, it will affright your enemie, and will make the Neuters to declare themſelves for the victour; it will keep your confederates faithfull and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, your ſubjects obedient, and will procure fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour from all men. Then the Armie muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with men and munitions, the enemies gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons muſt be ſummoned, recompenſing ſuch as ſhall yeeld the places within their cuſtody, deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rigorouſly with ſuch as ſhall be headſtrong, gaining the great ones of the countrey by money, eſtates, and honour, attempting to ſeize upon the advenues and paſſages, and to leave nothing at your back which might hinder the paſſage of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:23136:21"/> your munitions and victuall. If you be vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, either the enemie gives you time to retreat, or elſe he purſues you with all his forces. If he give you time, you muſt gather together all what poſſibly you can of your broken and ſcattered men, making your retreat reſolutely and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably, and ſhewing your ſelf in the field again ſo ſoon as may be with the greateſt number of ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers that can be gotten, to make head again againſt the enemie, to oppoſe his deſignes, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet and moleſt his actions, to work his confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates to oppoſe him, to divert and divide his forces, to fortifie the paſſages, to provide and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh your frontier places with victuall, munition, and garriſons.</p>
                  <p>If you be purſued with extremitie, you muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat in the beſt order you ſhall be able, making it appear you are not vanquiſhed in your cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, though you be ſo in your fortunes; cauſing all your countrey to take armes, and that ſuch as ſhall be in armes do preſent themſelves at the paſſage to hinder the enemies entrance, breaking down the bridges and landing-places of rivers, cutting of the high-wayes, and felling of trees to lay a croſſe the high-wayes, breaking down the ſluces, and drowning the countrey, if it be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, aſſuring your ſelf of the fidelitie of your ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and ſubjects, the one by forts, cittadels and garriſons; the other by hoſtages, offices and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>BEfore the fortifying of any place, conſideration muſt be had of the ſituation: for if it be on a mountain which is all a rock, and that the place comprehendeth all the top, it will be diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to approach, the flanks will be ſecured, it will be free from mines and command, it will eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcover round about, it will do horrible exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and will be wholeſome both for the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants and for the munitions. But ſuch a place hath uſually theſe diſcommodities, want of water and earth, hard to be retrenched, eaſie to be quickly blocked up, and the paſſages and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues for the releeving of it, eaſie to be cut off</p>
                  <p>If it be on a mountain which is not a rock, it will be ſubject to mining, the trenches of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach will be eaſily undermined, and it will have almoſt all the diſcommodities of the place above ſaid; but it will alſo have the advantage of ſtore of earth, and by that means it may eaſily be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched.</p>
                  <p>If the place be ſeated on a mountain which hath one or more advenues which command it, ſuch place will be eaſie to be aſſailed and battered from thoſe advenues.</p>
                  <p>If the place be mooriſh, the approaches are difficult, but the diſcommodities are great for them within it; for they are ſoon ſhut up, their ſallies are difficult and dangerous, the place is unwholeſome for the inhabitants, the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:23136:22"/> munitions are ſoon corrupted, and it is hard to be releeved.</p>
                  <p>If the place be on a plain, but commanded by one or more hills, it will have an infinite number of diſcommodities, and almoſt no conveniences.</p>
                  <p>If it be in a plain which is ſandy, the works which there ſhall be made will hardly be worth any thing.</p>
                  <p>But if it be on a plain champain, and levell on all ſides, the earth being fat and ſtrong, it will be eaſie there to fortifie, and to prevent the diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, having very advantageous conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</p>
                  <p>But whatſoever the ſituation be, if you intend there to fortifie, you muſt firſt calculate whether your means be ſufficient, whether the ſeaſon be fitting, whether you have a ſufficient number of workmen and tooles, time enough to finiſh it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſeaſon change, or the enemie can come upon you; whether you have ſouldiers enough to guard it, ſufficient Artillerie to defend it, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition enough for the ſouldiers and Artillerie, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall ſufficient for the men, and fodder for the horſes, ſuccours ſo near as that they may arrive within ſuch time as it may be conceived the fort may be maintained againſt the violence of the enemie.</p>
                  <p>If all theſe things do favour you, you may boldly fall to work, having regard firſt to the matter, and ſecondly to the forme.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the matter, if you have the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie of ſtone, brick, and chaulk, you muſt line all the works of the curtains, bullworks, and counterſcarps with good and ſtrong ſloapings, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner; thoſe of the curtain and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſcarp
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:23136:22"/> have a fourth part of the height for their ſloap, and thoſe of the faces of the Bullworks a third.</p>
                  <p>The faces of the Bullworks muſt have ſpurres, ten foot diſtant from each other, of three foot thick and 25 foot long, the ſaid ſpurres being ſtrongly bound in with the wall, which muſt be built in arches underpropped 6 foot without the foundations onely on the ſpurres.</p>
                  <p>If you have onely earth, there muſt be ſuch a ſloap given to the works, according as they are ſtrong or ſandy, ordinarily of 5 foot one. Such works muſt be well furniſhed with palliſadoes, and environed with water, for they are ſubject to ſurpriſes, becauſe the ſhowers of rain and froſts make them moulder away.</p>
                  <p>Touching the forme, if it be regular (which is when it hath the ſides equall) ſuch as the forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of one face is, ſuch are all the reſt. But if it be irregular (which is when the ſides be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall, as all cities are which are repaired) the fortification on all parts muſt be diſagreeing. But what forme ſoever it hath you muſt obſerve the rules following as much as may be, and labour to make it equally ſtrong on all ſides.</p>

                  <p>The politick order within the place containeth all things belonging to a civill life, as livelyhood, conſervation, and juſtice, both towards the towns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and ſouldiers: alwayes having an eye to their manners, life and condition, being aſſured of their fidelitie (but principally of the ſouldiers) before they be brought into the place. And being there, to have ſubtile and ſecret ſpies among them, who muſt obſerve how they live, what practiſes they have, whether they be diſcontented at the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and what they ſay in publick and in private: finally to have an eye to all their actions.</p>
                  <p>Touching his care without, he muſt take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of ſuch as enter, which are either countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who (under pretext either of bringing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſell, or of coming to buy) are let into the towne: or elſe merchants, who by occaſion of commerce do come in and go out at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Of theſe there muſt be regard had whether they deal with perſons ſuſpected, or that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves be ſuch, or whether they come from ſome ſuſpected place; and not to ſuffer any to enter, but perſons of good aſſurance, and well known.</p>
                  <p>The militarie care hath reſpect either to the gates or the walls. Of the gates, either at the opening or ſhutting of them.</p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:23136:30"/>
                  <p>Concerning the opening of them, he muſt (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſetting of them open) ſend out an officer with ſome ſouldiers, to diſcover whether there be any ambuſhes in the ſuburbs, churches, fields, decayed buildings, hollow wayes, valleys, ditches, incloſed gardens or woods: and at the ſhutting of them, the Sergeant Major muſt be there aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting as often as may be, and to ſearch and feel the lockes with his own hands.</p>
                  <p>Touching the walls, he ought to have regard whether they be low, ill flanked, decayed, the moat drie; and to uſe the remedies; as alſo to the places where the water entreth, or iſſueth out.</p>
                  <p>The gates and walls muſt be ſecured with good corps-du-guards, and ſentinells near each other. He muſt never ſlight the danger, but muſt alwayes ſuſpect and fear ſurpriſes and treaſons, being vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant and active: often viſiting his guards, and coming upon them at unawares: that ſo they may fear aſmuch to be ſurpriſed by the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour as by the enemie; which courſe will hold them to their duties.</p>

                  <head>Of the taking of fortreſſes by petard or any other ſurpriſe, or by treacherie. <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THey which have an enterpriſe upon any place, will ſurpriſe it either by petard, or by ſcalado, or by ſome other defect which is in the gates or walls, or elſe by intelligence and treacherie.</p>
                  <p>If you would ſurpriſe it by petard, you muſt firſt well know the gates, tails, barres, palliſadoes, draw-bridges, bridges, pitfalls, portcullices, and grates: and the places of the flanks, whether they be on the ſides, above, or before; whether the ditch be drie or filled with water; whether it be broad or deep; whether there be loop holes over the gate, corps-du-guards, and in what place; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the entrance into the gate be right on or wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and in all theſe things you muſt obſerve how many paces there may be of length, breadth, height, and diſtance between piece and piece, as near as may be.</p>
                  <p>The place being diſcovered, you muſt make uſe of ſtratagems to cloak your intentions, and to divert your enemy to ſome other place.</p>
                  <p>When there be any ſuburbs, decayed houſes or any woods near the place which you intend to ſurpriſe, you may make uſe of them to facilitate your approaches, and to lay your ambuſhes, alſo the eaſier to diſcover what is done about the gates of the town, ſo to lay hold on the occaſion at the inſtant when you ſee it fair for you; and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive advertiſements by thoſe perſons which you ſhall have ſent to diſcover the place.</p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:23136:31"/>
                  <p>Being thus near, you may to good purpoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve thoſe which give the firſt onſet, and diſpatch the readier; yet you muſt not approach ſo near, as that you be under command of their canon, for fear (if you be put to the retreat) you be had by the breech.</p>
                  <p>The time well taken doth much facilitate en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes, which is uſually a little before day, by reaſon that the ſentinels (being wearie and ſaint) do ſleep, and darkneſſe favoureth the approaches, and ſerves for cover of thoſe which put the plot in practice, prepare the engines, and plant the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tards, and thence gives terrour to the aſſailed.</p>
                  <p>The petards muſt be made of fine or red cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, with a tenth part of braſſe. That for the bridge muſt be 11 inches long, and at the breech 7 inches and a half about, and 5 inches wide with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. The metall at the breech muſt be one inch and one fourth part thick, and a half inch thick at the neck, without reckoning the muzzel ring. The mouth muſt be 10 inches wide, and it muſt have three handles, and a pipe over the touchhole joyning to the breech. It muſt weigh from 60 to 70 pound of metall.</p>
                  <p>That for gates with overthwart barres, muſt be 9 inches long, five twelve parts of an inch thick at the neck, and one inch at the breech. The mouth 7 inches wide, 6 on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the breech, and 4 within. It muſt weigh near upon 40 pound.</p>

                  <p>That for gates with plain bolts, or for palliſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does, muſt be 7 inches long, one third part of an inch thick at the neck, and three fourth parts of an inch at the breech, the mouth 4 inches wide, 3 inches and a half at the outſide of the breech, and 2 within. It muſt weigh near upon 15 pound.</p>

                  </figure>
                  <p>Between the petard and the bridge, there muſt be a madrier or wooden planchier placed, 1 foot and a half broad, 2 foot long, and 3 inches thick. If the wood be not very ſtrong, it muſt be ſtrengthened with plates of iron, being ſet on athwart on the outſide of the planchier, and lengthwiſe on the other ſide.</p>

                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:23136:32"/>
                  <p>The charge of the petard for the bridge is from 5 to 6 pound of poWder; of thoſe for ſtrong gates from 3 to 4 pound. And for palli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadoes ftom one pound and a half to two pound. They muſt be charged with the fineſt powder that can be had, beating it hard into the petard (but not ſo that you bruiſe the grain) which muſt be ſtopped with a wooden trencher or plug of an inch thick, very juſtly fitted, and ſome mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten wax to be powred on it to cloſe the rifts, and to keep the water from getting in, if perchance it ſhould fall into the water. The petard muſt not be charged up to the mouth, but there muſt be 3 fingers breadth left, which room muſt be filled up with towe or ſuch like, which muſt be preſſed down very hard, and then there muſt be a linnen cloth to cover the mouth of the petard, cloſe bound with a cord about the neck, to keep it in. Over the touchhole there muſt be applied a ſtopple of cork, and over it a plaiſter of wax or pitch, for fear of water.</p>
                  <p>Before the petard be hung on, you muſt have a priming iron to ſtirre the priming powder, which muſt be of a ſlow mixture (that ſo the petardier may have leiſure to retire, before the reverſe of the petard ſurpriſe him) and it muſt be fit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt water. It is compounded thus; take 3 parts of fine powder, 6 of ſulphur, and 9 of ſaltpeter, pound each of them apart very ſmall, then mix them together in a diſh with a ſtick; then poure oyle of peter into it by little and little (that ſo it may not become as a paſte) and let it drie through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the ſhadow, then lade your pipe with it.</p>
                  <p>The eaſieſt way to hang the petard at the barres or gates is by a fork, as this figure ſheweth.</p>

                  <p>But the petard for the bridge muſt be applied by a carriage, made as followeth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It muſt have a counterpoiſe at the taile mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on</hi> 2 <hi>wheels of three foot and a half high, and two inches and a half thick, mounted on a ſquare iron axletree, one inch and a half thick.

                     <figDesc>woodcut of two men using a petard</figDesc>
                  </figure>
                  <p>When there is a gate between the bridge and the draw bridge, the petard muſt be hung juſt at the middle of the bridge; but when there is no gate, the petard muſt be placed juſt againſt the drawbridge, that ſo meeting with the violence thereof, it may raiſe it on high, and by that means beat down the drawbridge.</p>
                  <p>If the bridge joyn not cloſe aloft (as often it hapneth) the petard muſt be placed as high as may be; for the violence of the blow which it will give againſt the ſtone-work of the gate, will fell it down.</p>
                  <p>To fell down a drawbridge which joyneth not well to the wall, it may be done without petard,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:23136:34"/> by a tortois of braſſe placed between the wall and the bridge, which will fell it down with the crack of it.</p>
                  <p>This tortois is made thus; Take 2 diſhes of braſſe which are made hollow 5 inches, 1 foot broad, and 2 inches thick; joyn them one againſt the other, and fill them with powder.</p>
                  <p>Ordinarily the good order, and good proviſion of all things neceſſarie, cauſeth the execution to ſucceed well: ſo the leaſt diſorder hindreth it. Therefore every thing muſt be commodiouſly ordered, diſtributing to ſeverall commanders the diverſitie of things which muſt be executed; as to arrive at the place 2 houres before day, to ſend out to diſcover, to know whether the enemie be not advertiſed, and whether he keeps himſelf on his guards (which would give you cauſe of chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging your purpoſe) to cauſe your carriages and rowling bridges to be joyned together farre enough from the gate, that ſo they of the town may not hear the mule go which carrieth them, and the noiſe of them which are to unloade them: to cauſe the petardiers to advance, each of them carrying his fork and planchier, and on his ſide a man carrying his petard, which ſhall make over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the barres, palliſadoes, and gates, ſo that the carriage of the petard for the bridge may paſſe, that ſo they may fell down the bridge. If the bridge be in ſeverall pieces, they muſt be drawn together with hooks. If one ſhaft keep up aloft, a petard muſt be applied to it. If the bridge fall into the moat, you muſt make uſe of a rowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-bridge. After that, there muſt be 2 crutches, ſhoats, or treſſels ſet under the portcullice to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it from being let down: but if it be let down
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:23136:35"/> down before, it muſt be overthrown by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of petards with great planchiers (if it be of wood) but if it be of iron, you muſt have a petard with ſtrong handles, to faſten one or more bowts of iron chains about them, having hooks at each end to graſp good ſtore of barres.</p>
                  <p>The gate being opened, you muſt readily ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour the firſt which ſeized on it, charging furiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon thoſe which ſhall oppoſe and make head againſt you, caſting granadoes and fire-pots amongſt them to diſorder them, attempting to gain their barricadoes by musketiers and pikes, making all poſſible ſpeed (for in this buſineſſe diligence doeth all) hindring the aſſailed from gaining time to joyn or rally themſelves toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to form a body to drive you out. You muſt place ſure guards at the gate, and ſeize upon the corps-du-guard (which is upon the walls and ramparts) alſo on the market-place, the churches, the town-houſe, and all places where the inhabitants might aſſemble, fortifie, and render combat. You muſt alſo ſuccour thoſe of your men which ſhall meet with reſiſtance, keeping them from pillaging, commanding every man to ſtand firm in his appointed place; untill the guards be placed, all the ſtreets and parts of the town be ſecured, and the quarters and lodgings for every one be laid out. But if you would ſurpriſe a gate of a town without petard, you muſt by diſcoverie or intelligence know whether it be ill guarded, whether there be few ſouldiers, whether they wander farre from their armes, whether the corps-du-guard be placed in a fit place to be ſurpriſed, whether the ſouldiers keep within it or about it; whether they leave the gate at any certain houre,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:23136:35"/> (as for their meals, their devotions, their ſports, or gathering of corn or grapes.) To know whether their commanders know their ſeverall charges, or whether they be negligent or ill obeyed, and that therefore the guards be diſordered, whether there be any place near, fit to favour your em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſcadoes (as ditches, garden walls, hemp, corn, hollow wayes) to give on upon the gate at the opening of it, amongſt the throng of thoſe that iſſue out, or a little after; for the guards (having quitted their armes, and put out their matches) may be ſurpriſed, before they can have means to recover themſelves.</p>
                  <p>You may cauſe the gates to be ſurpriſed by ſouldiers diſguiſed, in the habit of countrey fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, women, or merchants, bringing or conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of wares, wood, or hay, on their backs, by cart, waggon, or boat, (if there be a river, lake, or ſea) which may ſeize upon the gate, and hold it ſo long till they which are in ambuſh come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve them.</p>
                  <p>If you would ſurpriſe a place by ſcalado, you muſt firſt (by diſcoverie) know the advenues, the counterſcarp, and the moat; to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you may come at it undiſcovered, go in and out without difficultie, and that over againſt the place where you mean to give the ſcalado, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being compelled to take any great compaſſe about the ſame, otherwiſe you are in danger to be knockt, and taken in a trap. You muſt know whether the moat be drie or frozen, or the water ſhallow, without mud, and eaſie to wade through; whether the wall be low, ſo that it may be ſcaled, whether the place (where you mean to give on) be farre off from the corps-du-guard or ſentinell,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:23136:36"/> that you may not be diſcovered, whether the place be large enough to raiſe good ſtore of lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and conſequently for many men to enter at once; or ſtrait, where you muſt enter one by one; and to ſee, whether (after ſome of the firſt be entred) you could make a greater overture on the place, or at leaſt to have time to be all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred before day, or being diſcovered, to diſcover the place of the corps-du-guards, the neareſt place to be ranged in battalia, the market-places and churches, and to cauſe them to be ſeized upon by bataillons, ſending them at one and the ſame time towards the right and left hand, and right forward, the groſſe remaining firm in battalia to ſend ſuccours where need ſhall require, keeping neare ſome gate to gaine and open it, to let in the Cavallrie.</p>
                  <p>A place may be ſurpriſed (at the walls) without ſcalado, by ſome defect in them; as when they are old, decayed, weak, of little thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, of brick, ſtone, and clay, and without ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, for they may eaſily be pierced by ſome en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine or inſtrument: or if there be any lowe win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows along the curtain, or any ſallie-ports, or any ſink-holes or drains for filth, or places for wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to paſſe in and out, being ill guarded and weak.</p>
                  <p>Intelligences and treacheries may take effect, when ſome occaſion ſhall give you means to corrupt the fidelitie of thoſe of the place, which are able to give you entrance and deliver you the ſame. Theſe occaſions will be when you ſhall diſcover a poſſibilitie to convey ſome deſire of change into their mindes, which often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth amongſt high-minded ſouldiers which
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:23136:36"/> deſire to make a fortune; or amongſt thoſe which are revengefull, when they be diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented at the Governour or ſome other of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer. Beſides, moſt of them think themſelves ill dealt with, when they be not advanced to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, having a higher eſtimation of themſelves then they deſerve; and others be ſo cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, as there is nothing which they will not undertake for money. Theſe and the like things may accompanie intelligences and treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>

                  <head>How to beſiege and expugne cities. <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>A Citie is ſaid to be taken by force, when it is carried with an Armie by batterie; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto there belong three conſiderations: The firſt before the enterpriſe; The ſecond, during the time of the ſiege; and the third, after the taking of the citie.</p>
                  <p>Before the enterpriſe, you muſt conſider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you ought and whether you be able to do it.</p>
                  <p>You ought, when by this means you recover your own, weaken your enemie, you ſecure and fortifie your ſelf on that part, you encreaſe your revenue, and you get good ſtore of bootie. But you ought not to do it, if the charges of the ſiege will ſurmount your profit, or that it will be difficult to hold the place after you have gained it, or when it is ſo ſtrong, ſo well provided of all neceſſaries,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:23136:37"/> or ſo near to places of releef, that there is greater likelihood of dammage, then hope of good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe.</p>
                  <p>You are able, when you have all manner of proviſion neceſſarie for the enterpriſe, and that in ſufficient meaſure. The moſt neceſſarie things are money, ſouldiers, artillerie, munitions for the armes, as powder, bullets, morters, granadoes, muskets, pikes, &amp;c. And for the inſtruments, as ſhovels, pickaxes, hand-barrows, wheel-barrows, ſacks, baskets, &amp;c. And for wood to make plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms for the artillerie, gabions, ſauceidges, blindes, boats, &amp;c. And victuall in abundance. The quantitie of all theſe muſt be meaſured by that which ſhall be requiſite for the ſouldiers, the canon, and the time that the ſiege may be like to continue, which may be computed by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of your forces compared to thoſe of your enemie; by the qualities of the works of the place, with the number of your munitions and artillerie; by the garriſon, with your number of ſouldiers; by the ſituation of the place, and the releef which might be brought to it, with the means which you ſhall have to ſtop and hinder it, and to facilitate the bringing of victuall into your camp; by the diſtance, with the meanes to lead your armie thither; by the qualitie of the ground, with the conveniences which you have to make your approaches.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe that oftentimes accidents do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall which were not foreſeen, as by unexpected releef, an inundation or overflowing of waters, a change of weather, a mutinie amongſt your own men, or a contagion.</p>
                  <p>There muſt be a provident care taken for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:23136:37"/> ſo as (being conſtrained to it) it may be made commodiouſly and eaſily without diſorder, if it may be: for thereon dependeth the honour or diſhonour, the profit or dammage of the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailant.</p>
                  <p>During the ſiege, you muſt obſerve many things with good order, and principally theſe; Firſt, you muſt environ and ſhut up the place, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenching your ſelf round about, fortifying your ſelf as well againſt thoſe which might come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve them, as againſt the ſallies of the town, in ſuch ſort as not any perſon may be able to go in nor out; chooſing a fit place for the Armie to ſet down, to make the field of battaile, to make your quarters and their alarm-places. Taking care that the quarters be ſecured by good retrenchments and forts, well flanked and guarded, within againſt the ſallies, and without againſt ſuch as might come to releeve the place, or diſturb your Armie: that they be commodious to receive and conſerve the munitions for actions and executions. You muſt diſpoſe the approaches, run your trenches, make your way to arrive in ſafetie to the place where you intend to raiſe your batterie, obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that it be as ſhort as may be, ſheltered and faithfully guarded by a good number of men, having room enough between piece and piece, and for their reverſe, and that they command the place which you intend to batter; that the trenches be ample, large, deep, not ſtraitned, well ſlanked and defended by forts more or fewer, according to the ſtrength of the garriſon which is within the place, and to the time in which the releef might arrive.</p>
                  <p>During the time whileſt you are making the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:23136:38"/> trenches of approach, you muſt take away all the high flanks with the canon, then ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving run your trenches to the counterſcarp, you muſt raiſe platforms with beds for the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillerie, near the points of the counterſcarp, to take away all the low flanks, by this means to render the paſſage of the moat ſecure. And whileſt this batterie is a making, you muſt pierce the counterſcarp, and advance your galleries, untill you joyn them to the Bull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work; at the ſame time beginning the ſap and the mine. But if you be put to force it by Artillerie, diſpoſe your batterie ſo that it may commodiouſly diſcover the place which you intend to batter; that there be room and libertie for the pieces, loop-holes, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions, guards and officers; that it be not expoſed to the Artillerie of the enemie, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo, that it be ſheltered by traverſes and gabions, making it hollow underneath if you fear mines, and retrenching it round about to meet with the ſallies of thoſe of the town; furniſhing it with planks and pent-houſes againſt their granadoes and ſtone-pieces; alſo not approaching too near, to prevent their fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works and granadoes. Make your batterie fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly and in good order, battering within a fathome of the foundation of the wall, piercing it in divers places; then batter it acroſſe to make the wall to totter. The breach being made, you muſt cauſe it to be viewed by men choſen to that purpoſe, each ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a head-piece on his head musket proof, and a target with a long rift, and another rift acroſſe that. The breach muſt be acceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:23136:38"/> and not too right on, capable of many aſſailants, having all the flanks broken both high and low. The ſouldiers which are to give the aſſault muſt aſcend in good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, aſſail furiouſly, fight obſtinately, and they muſt either be repulſed by thoſe of the garriſon, or remain maſters of the place. If they be repulſed by the ſole valour of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, in this caſe (without delay or ſuffering the enemie to gather breath) you muſt charge them again with freſh men and in greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſo often, untill you enter by force; for fighting onely againſt men, it were a ſhame that a greater number of freſh men ſhould not force them.</p>
                  <p>If ſome retrenchment and new fortification made by the garriſon hath held the aſſailants from paſſing further; in this caſe, if that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification be weak, it muſt be forced by the ſap and mine, ſcaling ladders, fireworks and granadoes; but if it be ſtrong, you muſt lodge upon the breach, and preſently again begin the ſap and mine and approach, and draw up ſome piece of ordinance on the breach.</p>
                  <p>Whileſt theſe things above ſaid be in the executing you muſt moleſt the beſieged by all poſſible means you can, as by attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them by treacherie, making them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume their munitions in ſhort time and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitably, breaking the conveyances of their waters, making feigned batteries, confounding their ſignalls by making the like, ſtirring up cauſes of ſuſpicion amongſt themſelves, often making falſe alarmes,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:23136:39"/> taking heed that you be not affronted by ſpies, cauſing it to be made known that you want no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to bring the ſiege to an end, galling them with fireworks, granadoes, and artillerie, in their magazines, corps-du-guards, and alarm-places; finally giving no reſt to the aſſailed untill you have either forced them, or be conſtrained to retreat.</p>
                  <p>If you carrie the town by force, and remain maſter of the place, the bootie is to be given to the ſouldiers (principally to thoſe which made the aſſault) which are the priſoners and ſpoils of the enemie, alwayes having regard to the women and children to deal fairly with them.</p>
                  <p>If it be commodious and advantageous to the vanquiſher to preſerve the fortreſſe, he muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair it preſently, emptying the moat where it was filled up, laying plain the trenches, throwing down the cavalleroes and batteries without, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing and making up the breaches, returning the waters into their naturall courſe if they were turned our, fortifying the place better then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly it was, if it may be, providing it of a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient garriſon, of good, valiant, and prudent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours and Captains, of victuall, armes, manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, mechanicall inſtruments, and Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries drugs.</p>
                  <p>If it be not advantageous to maintain the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe, he muſt cauſe it to be demantled, and all the fortification of it to be raſed; leaving the houſes entire, provided that afterward they may not again fortifie there, nor endammage him.</p>

Knowing all theſe things, you muſt be informed of the munitions of the town, the number of the garriſon, how many horſe, what commanders, what ſouldiers, what number of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillerie, as well great as ſmall; what powder, and how much, what Enginiers, what makers of fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:23136:40"/> and what Canoniers; whether they be at unitie within the town, or whether there be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions.</p>
                     <p>The Generall being well informed of all theſe things, being reſolved to force the place, becauſe he ſhall judge it faiſeable, he muſt ſend his troops of light horſemen to overrun and waſt the countrey round about, and to take priſoners, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to be informed more certainly of the eſtate of the place.</p>

                     <p>He muſt make his quarters in ſuch place as is moſt ſecured from the canon ſhot of the town, in the beſt aire, where he may beſt have the commoditie of water (and wood if it may be) and the faireſt ſituation to make the alarm-place.</p>
                     <p>He is to ordain the quarters of his Armie, and ſhall cauſe the line of circumvallation to be well retrenched and guarded, both againſt releefs, and againſt thoſe of the town.</p>
                     <p>He ought not to have ſo much regard of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulting the town in that part where it is weakeſt, as of the commoditie and ſecuritie of his camp and his quarters: and commonly the approaches are made from thoſe places.</p>
                     <p>The trenches muſt not begin nearer to the place then harquebus a crock ſhot, or at leaſt musket ſhot, running them ſo that they be not ſeen ſtraight along by

                     <p>The place of the Artillerie intended to batter the high flanks and parapets, muſt be raiſed ſo high, that it may command them; but that which ſhould make the breach and beat down the walls, muſt be ſunk into the counterſcarp, battering the wall between winde and water (if there be any) or at a fathom height above the ſuperficies of the ditch, if it be drie. The firſt is placed when you begin your trenches of approach, to favour them; the other, when you lay your gallerie to pierce the counterſcarp, this batterie makes the breach, and beats down the low flanks. Whileſt this bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie is a making, you are to pierce the counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcarp, and to have the boats or the wood for the galleries in readineſſe, to bring them to the face of the Bullwork, and to go to the aſſault ſo ſoon as you have ſhot a breach, or to ſap and mine the face of the Bullwork, and there to lodge in caſe you cannot advance further, and to carrie it by force.</p>
                     <p>You muſt lodge your musketiers within the trenches, and eſpecially in thoſe which run along by the counterſcarp, that ſo they may beat away all thoſe of the town that might appear, as well on the curtains as caſemats.</p>
                     <p>You muſt alwayes make the breach on the faces of the Bullworks near their points, unleſſe ſome advantage do incite you to do otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p>The entrances to the galleries on the moat muſt be as farre diſtant from the flanks as may be, but in ſuch ſort as they be not ſeen but of one
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:23136:41"/> flank. The more galleries there be, the better. Cauſe your granadoes to play into the middle of the Bullworks ſo continually, that you may hinder the enemie from working there, or there placing their guard.</p>
                     <p>If the moat be full of water, you muſt emptie it, or paſſe over it by floating bridges (which is dangerous) or by galleries, which is not ſo ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardable.</p>
                     <p>You may emptie it, when there is near hand ſome place lower then the ditch, by piercing the counterſcarp, and giving the water a courſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the place; or elſe you may make a ditch, and pierce the counterſcarp to cauſe the water to run into it, which is drawn out by pumps. Or elſe you are to make floating bridges of barrels or bundles of cork. But if the moat be ſhallow, you may make galleries with ſauceidges. Theſe ſau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceidges are made of faggots of bruſh wood, from 15 to 20 foot long, and one foot thick in dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter (all ſtuffed with rubbiſh to keep them from floating on the water) then upon theſe ſauceidges you are to lay hurdles or planks.</p>
                     <p>If the moat be drie and of earth, you muſt make trenches: uſually to that which is drie (if a breach be made) you make neither trench nor gallerie, but you take away all the flanks to paſſe it ſecure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and you ſhelter your ſelf on the ſides by hurdles, bruſh wood, or gabions.</p>
                     <p>If you force the place by little and little, and that the ditch be of a rock, you muſt make a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe within the ditch with ſauceidges, or with gabions, or with linnen ſacks full of earth.</p>
                     <p>Having paſſed the moat, you are to give the aſſault (if the breach be ſufficient or ill retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:23136:42"/> or elſe you are to lodge at the foot of the Bullwork, and to go to the ſap and mine; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their effect you muſt give the aſſault, advance, or lodge.</p>
                     <p>If the retrenchment of the aſſailed be great, firm, and ſtrong, having gained the Bullwork, you muſt there draw up and plant your ordnance, and make your batterie the moſt ſpeedy and violen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> that may be.</p>
                     <p>Nothing ſo much affrighteth the aſſailed as a furious and expedited batterie, for he hath not leiſure to retrench himſelf, and knows not where to range himſelf to be under ſhelter.</p>
                     <p>That doth much wearie and moleſt the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged, when they are aſſaulted at 3 or 4 ſeverall Bullworks, at 3 or 4 corners of the town; they are in continuall ſuſpicion, they have their forces diſunited, they cannot prevent falſe alarms, their labours are very great, and their guards much more toilſome and inſupportable. Beſides that, every man is diffident of the other guards, breaches, retrenchments, and of their endeavour to make good defence.</p>
                     <p>It alſo much diſcommodateth the beſiegers, for their forces are diſunited, their quarters are farre from each other, they are in danger to be hard put to it by ſallies or by ſuccours, being ſo ſcattered.</p>

                  <p>THat is called taking fortreſſes by famine, when through want of victuall, they are conſtrained to yeeld themſelves to the power of the beſieger. You muſt therefore before you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege it, be well informed (by means of your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligencers and ſpies) of the munitions which be within the place, as well of victuall as drink. You muſt alſo know what townſmen and what garriſon there be, and by that you are to judge how long their proviſion will laſt them, and what means you have to hinder their revictualling. You are to begin the ſiege a little before har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt, becauſe their proviſions will be almoſt ſpent, and that they ſhall have no means to have new; making waſte of that about the town which might ſtand them in ſtead, and hindring them from water if it be poſſible. You are to batter down their gates and bridges with your Artillerie, and alſo you muſt attempt to break down their mills and magazines, firing them by fire-balls. When you intend to beſiege them, you muſt ſurpriſe them on the ſudden, leaſt they ſend out their unprofitable eaters, and attempt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide themſelves. You muſt have good ſtore of Cavallrie, to be maſter of the field, and alwayes to ſend out upon diſcoverie. The town muſt be ſhut up with trenches round about, fortified with many good forts, that ſo you may hinder their revictualling, and withſtand the force of a releef, if it be to be expected: as the Prince <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice</hi> did before Grave, <hi>anno</hi> 1602. and before Sluce <hi>anno</hi> 1604.</p>

                  <head>Of the defence of fortreſſes againſt the petard, and other ſurpriſes and treacheries. <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THey which would prevent being ſurpriſed muſt have two conſiderations; the one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the attemptours, the other touching the fortreſſe.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the attemptours, you muſt (if poſſibly you can) have ſpies amongſt them; at leaſt you muſt keep ſentinels as farre diſtant from the fortreſſe as may be, that ſo the Enemie arrive not and be on your jack at unawares and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being diſcovered.</p>
                  <p>Touching the fortreſſe, you muſt not unfurniſh it to ſupply other places, ſo as that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth be not ſufficient to keep and ſerve it. You muſt appoint the place of rendez-vous for the ſouldiers and citizens in fitting parts of the town, and that they ſtirre not from their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall places without command from the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, or Sergeant Major, whatſoever pretence the enemie may make to charge the town in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers parts.</p>
                  <p>The lodgings of the Governour or Sergeant Major ſhould be about the middle of the town, near ſome ſpacious place, which muſt be the alarm-place of the town.</p>
                  <p>There muſt be iron chains at the corners of the croſſe ſtreets which are before the gates of the town: and you muſt batter down the fronts of the houſes which are juſt over againſt the gates, with canon ſhot: and place one corps-du-guard in the alarm-place, another about the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:23136:49"/> middle of the moat before the bridge, in the manner of a dovehouſe, into which the entrance is by a little draw-bridge; another on every gate of the town, into which none may enter but by a moving plank; and others round about the walls, near enough each to other: and theſe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with ſouldiers more or leſſe, according to the capacitie of the place, and the danger.</p>
                  <p>The corps-du-guard of the alarm-place hath the charge to make the rounds, counter-rounds, and grand-round, and to place the ſentinels; which muſt be at ſo near a diſtance, as they may heare and underſtand each others ſpeech, and ſpecially at the corners and the chanell holes, or drains of water.</p>
                  <p>You muſt place ſentinell-perdues without the town, which is the charge of the corps-du-guard which is without before the bridge. If there be a dam of earth between two moats round about the town, there muſt be guards placed in the night, for that is a moſt ſecure remedy againſt ſurpriſes. This dam of earth may be apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the figure following:</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The gates and bridges muſt be flanked on both ſides, and on the upper part with loop-holes, which muſt be large enough to caſt water out at them, alſo pieces of timber, ſtones, granadoes, to quench the fire of a petard, to beat it down, and to kill the petardiers. But not ſo wide that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes may be made by them, and there to give the ſcalado. Some place a portcullice there, hung by a rope, which is very fit to beat down the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tards.</p>
                  <p>If you make half moons before the gates of the town, they will be the ſtronger, and the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſheltred from the champain.</p>
                  <p>You muſt keep a light piece of Artillerie (but having a great calibre) at the corps-du-guard of the gate, which muſt be charged with car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touches and rubbiſh or ſtones, to turn it towards the place where the enemie ſhall give on.</p>
                  <p>The moats muſt be deep, having a palliſado in the middle; ſuch as have water need not be full, for that facilitateth the boats for the ſurpriſe.</p>
                  <p>The curtains and faces of the Bullworks muſt be ſeen and diſcovered by the flanks of the town, even by the low flanks, that ſo the canon may ruine all the ladders which might be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to be there raiſed.</p>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:23136:51"/>
                  <p>The curtains muſt be high and out of danger of ſcalado, if it may be.</p>
                  <p>The holes by which the water comes in, or drains of filth paſſe out, ought to be very ſtrait; built of lime and ſtone, oblique within the wall, bound with ſtrong grates of iron, having a corps-du-guard or a ſentinell on the wall juſt over againſt the ſaid grate.</p>
                  <p>To be well aſſured of the gates and walls, the way is to appoint good guards, and thoſe dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, ſtrong, and well placed: thoſe on the walls muſt be ſet preſently after the ſhutting of the gates before night; and they muſt not be diſmiſſed untill day, and untill the ſentinell on the ſteeple hath given the ſignall by the bell; and that no man knoweth the place where he ſhall be placed untill the very inſtant that he entreth the guard.</p>
                  <p>You may prevent treacheries knowing the cauſe; for either it proceedeth from the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour who hath evill entreated, diſgraced, or offended the ſouldier in his reputation, perſon, or means, and provoked him to an evill diſpoſition; or it proceedeth from the ſouldier who is am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious of honour and degrees, or covetous of greater means; or elſe from the citizens who are tyranniſed over by the garriſon.</p>
                  <p>This matter is ſo tickliſh, that the very ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion is puniſhable; but the better way is to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble it, and to cauſe the matter to be further attempted; mean time doubling your rounds, and making extraordinarie counter-rounds.</p>

                  <p>A Fortreſſe is ſaid to have reſiſted the enemies forces, when (having well defended it ſelf) it remaineth in its former libertie. To do this, you muſt draw into the fortreſſe whatſoever will be uſefull for you, and ruine all without which might endammage you; laying flat houſes, woods, barns, mills, hollow wayes, gardens, foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and whatſoever might batter you and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand your defences.</p>
                  <p>Take good heed that the fortreſſe be well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to reſiſt the aſſault of the enemie: which is, that the flanks (whether they be high or lowe) may diſcover, and not be diſcovered but by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bocking, that is, the canons mouth: that the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines be well diſpoſed and convenient; that the counterſcarp (which is the buckler of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe) be flanked, ſheltred, and ſpacious; that the caſemats be ſecured and well ſheltred, ſpacious, and fit to diſcover the plain of the oppoſite bull-work, and within the moat; that the ſally-ports be ſecured, ſheltred, lowe, and commodious that the parapets be of earth or unburnt brick, and that the platforms for the ordinance be made hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely and even, that ſo the pieces may ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>The number of the ſouldiers of your garriſon you are to proportion according to the bigneſſe of the place, to the outworks which you would hold, to the labour of the retrenchments which

                  <p>The Governour muſt be courageous and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert by long practice in aſſaulting and defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, having been beaten to ſuch ſervices.</p>

                  <p>Then in ordering of his quarters you muſt have an eye, that even upon this occaſion you might moleſt him; nevertheleſſe if you conceive that by ſuffering him to go on ſecurely, you ſhould have means afterward to offend him to greater effect, you may defer it untill then: for thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodities which ſucceed with loſſe of that which one poſſeſſeth, bring double dammage.

                  <p>For your ſallies, take good heed to the time, whether it be fitting or contrarie; to the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as when the enemie is wet, ſtiff with cold, ſleepy, tired with labour, or when the guard is not in ſuch number, qualitie, and order as it ought. Keep your ſelf under the favour of your rampart and Artillerie, go on in good order and at un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares, by means of your ſally ports and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſcarps, place your pikes and halberts to ſuſtain a charge, your muskets and callivers to give the charge, your fireworks and granadoes to break and diſſipate thoſe which are in the corps-du-guards and forts of the trenches, favouring the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanterie by the Cavallrie, principally at the retreat, which muſt be well ſecured, being ſuſtained by thoſe which you have left as a reſerve on the counterſcarp. Be not ſo prodigall of your ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers and munitions, that you ſhall not have ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to guard the town and to ſuſtain the aſſaults. When the aſſailant ſhall begin to play his canon to batter your high and lowe defences, ply him on all ſides with your Artillerie from your Bullworks, ramparts, and cavalleroes; repair the ſhoulders of your flanks and parapets the beſt you can. Make new places of retreat and new flanks, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally concealed ones.</p>
                  <p>When he ſhall pierce your counterſcarp or open your moat, he will at the ſame time batter your walls; if he have forgotten nothing of that diligence which is requiſite, you ſhall hardly hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der nor offend him. But if he do miſtake, ſeize you on the occaſion, and have a watchfull eye, as if his Artillerie be diſcovered, you ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to diſmount his pieces, to kill his canoniers, to ſpoil his munitions; if it be ill fortified, make
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:23136:55"/> a furious ſally upon it, to diſmount and nail it up, making uſe of your Artillerie and muskets.</p>
                  <p>If the aſſailant be well experienced, whileſt he is battering you to make a breach, he will batter all the low flanks which flank the place where he intendeth to give the aſſault (the high flanks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing already taken off before the Artillerie was brought on the counterſcarp) but not before he become maſter of the moat, if it be drie, or of the counterſcarp if the moat be full of water; making the platform for the Artillerie upon the gallerie which pierceth the counterſcarp to enter the moat, keeping the boats and galleries to paſſe over the moat ready to lay ſuddenly when the time and occaſion ſhall be fit to give the aſſault; or elſe to plant them during the batterie under favour of the Artillerie and musket ſhot. Now, againſt all this, an expert Governour will keep his flanks hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, which being opened unawares will much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dammage the aſſailant, who (having made a breach) will cauſe it to be viewed by armed men (on which you muſt not ſpare your faulconet ſhot, nor that of the harquebus a crock) and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily they are of the moſt able and valiant men.</p>
                  <p>The breach being viewed, he will come to the aſſault, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>or which you muſt order your ſelf to give combat and reſiſt him, either by handblows or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenching your ſelf, or both; by handblows, ſo ſoon as he ſhall begin to ſhew himſelf and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a mark for you, beginning to mount up to the breach, repulſing him by armed men, which you ſhall have ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>lected before the aſſault, being reſolute and hardy, which muſt headſtrongly withſtand the firſt furie; which will either cauſe the enemie to retreat, or at leaſt you ſhall notably
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:23136:56"/> miſchief him. You are to make uſe of engines and inſtruments fitting to hinder the enemie from climbing up to the breach, as calthrops ſtrewed upon the place, rowling I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

Mines muſt not be forgotten, nor fire-works, as fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trunks, pots, moveable mines, fire-garlands, &amp;c. having carefull regard how, when, where, and from whence you caſt them, doing it to good purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>If the enemie aſſault you by degrees, or that he make his batterie ſo leiſurely that he give you time to retrench your ſelf, make your retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment well flanked and commodious, in ſuch ſort that by it you may reſiſt him. To effect this, it ought to be difficult to be expugned, ſo flanked as it may be defended on the front and flanks, facile for ſallies, having before it a broad and deep moat with a counterſcarp and covert way, having the rampart ſtrengthened by palliſadoes which go along the outſide of the line, enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the camp, and gabions: And by this means you ſhall draw the buſineſſe to a great length: for he muſt draw up his Artillerie upon the breach, after that he be lodged upon it, he muſt make a new batterie, a new overture, new ſaps, mines, and chambers, which will give you leiſure to make new retrenchments, and to gain and prolong the time, as the Hollanders did at Oſtend, and in many other places.</p>

                  <p>For the diſtribution, regard muſt be had to the time, to the perſons, and to the quantitie.

                  <p>To effect it, either openly or ſecretly, having regard to the place, to the enemies retrenchments, and to the releef.</p>
                  <p>To the ſituation of the place, which may be commodious and facile by reaſon of the open champains and freedome from impeachments; or diſcommodious and difficult, by reaſon of bogs, rivers, woods, and mountains.</p>

                  <p>For the releef, it muſt be guarded by a good convoy, becauſe otherwiſe the enemie might charge and rout it, pillaging the munitions, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring the return, cutting off their way, being the ſtronger.

                  <p>IN the founding of ordinance, to 100 pound of fine copper, you are to adde 20 pound of bell-metall; or for want of bell-metall, adde 10 pound of ſoft tin.</p>

                  <p>In the founding of ordinance, in regard of the waſte, in every 6 pound of metall you are to adde 1 pound over weight.</p>
                  <p>A ſingular care muſt be taken of the melting and mixing of metals, for the inward neatneſſe of the pieces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To this end the materials muſt be good, ſo muſt the earth for the moules; being well beaten and through wrought with hair and flocks. The moules, models and cilinders well nointed and greaſed with good tallow, and bound with hoops of iron, well and throughly nealed, well placed and ſet. The trunions muſt be ſo juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:23136:58"/> placed, as the piece may be as in ballance on them, weighing almoſt equally forwards to her muzzel, as backwards towards her breech, that ſo a canonier may without trouble mount or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe her.</p>
                  <p>The piece muſt be ſtrong about the trunions, for thereabout ſhe ſuffereth the greateſt force, and firſt moving.</p>
                  <p>The touchhole muſt be of ſteel, that ſo the piece be not made unuſefull ſo ſoon as if it were of metall, and muſt be cloſe to the breech.</p>
                  <p>The pieces muſt be well repaired, cleared, and tried, having regard that there be not any chink, hole, hony-comb, crack, rift, flaw, or crany with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them; which uſually hapneth when the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall is run too cold, or that the moule be not well nealed, or that the tin was put in before the cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per was well melted, or that it was not throughly mixed or incorporated.</p>
                  <p>The pieces ought to be tried before they be mounted on their carriages, the muzzels of them mounted, for ſo they bear the greateſt ſtreſſe. When they be ſo repaired, cleared, and tried, they are to be weighed, and their weight to be cut on their breech.</p>

                     <p>In the armie the Colonell cannot give leave to a ſouldier to depart from his regiment, but to change his Companie; the firſt appertaining onely to the Generall.</p>
                     <p>The Colonell ought to be called to councell by the Generall, when matters are to be agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted which belong to his charge; where he ſhall heare the opinion of others, and freely ſpeak his own. And if it be about a matter of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, and that he knoweth his opinion to be good, though the contrarie opinions (being ſtronger in number) do carrie it, he ought to commit his opinion to writing, to purge himſelf before his Soveraigne, in caſe the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the councell prove ill. Mean time, he muſt give way to the pluralitie of voices, and entirely obey his Generall, and appear in all

                     <p>The Colonell muſt render all manner of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Generall of the armie, and to the Generall of Infanterie, (for they have power to command him) and to the Marſhall of the field, as having the charge from the Generall to give the orders, the quarter, the alarm-place, the field for the battaile; to cauſe the forces to march, lodge, diſlodge, enter into guard, convoy, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The aſſiſtants to the Marſhall of the field, or the Sergeant major Generall cannot command him any thing as of themſelves, but by order ſigned by the Generall, or the Marſhall of the field for the armie, with the plats and deſignes of the ground of the ſtations and places for combat, giving command by vertue thereof.</p>

                  <p>To double files or ranks, is to put two into one. Doubling of files is called doubling the flanks, or doubling the depth; doubling of ranks is called doubling the front.</p>
                  <p>Files are doubled after three wayes, either in inplacing the one within the other, which is called doubling of files ſidewayes. In this doubling the even numbers of files mix themſelves within the odde numbers, and the file-leaders which are to move, place themſelves behinde them which are to ſtand faſt, and every ſouldier behinde his right hand man.</p>

                  <head>Of the Romane Militia, in the time of Polybius. <hi>CHAP. XVII.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THe Romanes managed their martiall affairs after this manner: They choſe out of all the people ſuch as were moſt fit to bear armes, as well for the Infanterie as for the Cavallrie.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the Infanterie, the pooreſt and youngeſt of them were appointed to be <hi>Velites;</hi> the next above theſe, to be <hi>Haſtati;</hi> they which were in the flower of their age, to be <hi>Principes;</hi> and the ancienteſt to be <hi>Triarii.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The armes of theſe foure ſorts of ſouldiers were theſe: The <hi>Velites</hi> bore a ſword, a javelin or dart three foot long, and an inch thick, with an iron at the end one foot long, a target of three foot in diameter, and an head-piece of leather; ſome bore ſlings, and ſome bows.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Haſtati</hi> and <hi>Principes</hi> bore each of them a target (two foot and an half broad, and foure foot long, or foure foot and an handfull) a ſharp-pointed ſword, and cutting on both ſides, and very ſtiff, an head-piece of braſſe with creſts and plumes, two piles of wood, the one ſlender as a dart, three cubits long, with an iron at the end; and one thick one, an handfull in thickneſſe, three cubits alſo in length, at the end whereof there was an iron of the length of the pile, half whereof was driven into the wood, which was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened ſtrongly thereunto, the other half extended, with a ſharp point, being furniſhed with hooks.
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:23136:100"/> This iron, next to the wood, was one finger and an half thick, the finger being accounted at foure barly kernels, and the handfull at foure fingers breadth.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Triarii</hi> bore the ſame armes which the <hi>Principes</hi> did, ſaving the piles, for in ſteed of them they bore pikes.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Haſtati</hi> uſed to bear them in former time, and had their name from thence, but they quitted them to take piles.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Haſtati, Principes,</hi> and <hi>Triarii</hi> bore a breaſt-plate of braſſe or iron, a foot ſquare; and the richer ſort armed themſelves with ſcales or mails, faſtned together with hooks.</p>
                  <p>In a legion there were 4200 men of the foure ſorts of ſouldiers aforeſaid, <hi>Velites, Haſtati, Principes,</hi> and <hi>Triarii;</hi> divided after this manner: There were 600 <hi>Triarii,</hi> 1200 <hi>Principes,</hi> 1200 <hi>Hiſtatï,</hi> and as many <hi>Velites.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As well the <hi>Haſtati, Principes,</hi> as <hi>Triarii,</hi> were divided each into ten parts, called Maniples; ſo that in a legion there were 30 Maniples, without reckoning the <hi>Velites;</hi> for they were equally diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted amongſt each Maniple. The <hi>Haſtati</hi> being 1200, divided into ten Maniples, each contained 120 men; ſo much were thoſe of the <hi>Principes,</hi> and 60 thoſe of the <hi>Triarii;</hi> and dividing the 1200 <hi>Velites</hi> by 30, to ſerve for ſuch as uſed fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weapons to the Maniples aforeſaid, it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that every Maniple of <hi>Velites</hi> contained 40 men.</p>
                  <p>One Maniple of <hi>Haſtati,</hi> one Maniple of <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipes,</hi> and one of the <hi>Triarii</hi> with the <hi>Velites,</hi> made a Cohort: for there were ten Cohorts in a Legion, and ſix Maniples in a Cohort; namely,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:23136:100"/> one of the <hi>Haſtati,</hi> one of the <hi>Principes,</hi> one of the <hi>Triarii,</hi> and three of the <hi>Velites.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Velites</hi> fought disbanded, keeping neither rank nor order, and it was their dutie to begin the skirmiſh and battaile; but the <hi>Haſtati, Principes,</hi> and <hi>Triarii,</hi> were ranged into Maniples. All the Maniples of the <hi>Haſtati</hi> ſtood in one front, ſo did thoſe of the <hi>Principes,</hi> in the rear of them, and thoſe of the <hi>Triarii</hi> in like manner in the rear of the <hi>Principes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The diſtance of the Maniples was ſuch, that one Maniple might ſtand betwixt two of them, becauſe that if the <hi>Haſtati</hi> were repulſed, they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat into the intervalls or ſpaces which were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Maniples of the <hi>Principes,</hi> and ſo fight together. And if both <hi>Haſtati</hi> and <hi>Principes</hi> were defeated, they might retreat between the Maniples of <hi>Triarii,</hi> and ſo fight again all together, as well <hi>Haſtati,</hi> and <hi>Principes,</hi> as <hi>Triarii.</hi>

                  <p>Over every Maniple were two commanders, called Centurions, a firſt, and a ſecond; when both of them were preſent with their Maniple, the firſt
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:23136:101"/> commanded the right flank, and the ſecond the left: and if one of them were abſent, he which was preſent commanded the whole Maniple. In every Maniple were two Enſignes, one under each Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion, and two Sergeants. Every ten men had alſo a commander, called a Decurion, and over all the Legion there were ſix Tribunes or commanders in chief.</p>
                  <p>Every Legion had 300 horſe, divided into ten troops called Turmes, every one of which had 30 ſouldiers, three whereof were Decurions or file-leaders, and three bringers-up. The firſt file-lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, called the Prefect, commanded the troop, in his abſence the ſecond, and in eithers abſence the third did it. In every troop there was a Cornet.</p>

                  <p>The Romanes made uſe of their Allies in their warres, and had a like number of foot of their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies as they had of citizens of Rome, and the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions were alike in form, armes, and number of men: but concerning the Cavallrie, the Allies
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:23136:101"/> were double the number of the Romanes. It is true that of the foot they took the fifth part, and of the horſe the third part for extraordinarie, and the reſt of the foot they divided into two equall parts, which they placed on the flanks of the armie, and called thoſe on the right hand, The right wing, and thoſe on the left hand, The left wing, ſo that when the Roman Legions conſiſted of 4200 men, the wings of the Allies were 3360, and the Maniples of the <hi>Haſtati</hi> and <hi>Principes,</hi> each of them were 92; of the <hi>Triarii</hi> 60; and of the <hi>Velites</hi> 30. And the troop of extraordinarie foot in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wing was 840 men. The Cavallrie of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies for every of their Legions was 600 horſe (double the number of the Romanes) of theſe they took a third part (namely 200) for extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie, and divided the remaining 400 into ten Turmes, each of them of 40 horſe, over which there were a Cornet, a Prefect, three Decurions or file-leaders, and three bringers-up, as amongſt the Romanes. Theſe extraordinaries were imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for guards for the Conſuls, and for troops of reſerve in combats.</p>
                  <p>When foure Legions were ranged in battaile, all the Roman Cavallrie was on the right hand, that of the Allies on the left hand, and the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie Cavallrie of the Allies was placed on the right hand of the Roman horſe, and the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie Infanterie of the Allies was ranged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Legions and the wings, over againſt the <hi>Triarii.</hi>

                  <p>When the Legion conſiſted of 4000 men, more or leſſe, it was divided according to the aforeſaid proportion; as when the Legion contained 5100 men, the <hi>Velites, Haſtati,</hi> and <hi>Principes,</hi> were each of them 1500, and the Maniples of the <hi>Haſtati</hi> and <hi>Principes</hi> 150.

                  <p>The Legions have oft-times been augmented; for in <hi>Romulus</hi> his time they contained 3000 foot and 300 horſe.</p>
                  <p>In the time of <hi>Camillus,</hi> they were 4000 foot and 300 horſe.</p>

                  <p>And in the time when the Sabines joyned themſelves with the Romanes, it conſiſted of 6000 foot and 600 horſe.</p>
                  <p>When the armie was thus ſtrong, the Legions were ranged in battalia by Cohorts, and not by Maniples.

Deliberating</hi> to make <hi>warre, peace, truce, parly, alliance, league;</hi> Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the diverſitie of <hi>perſons,</hi> as <hi>compatriots, allies, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, mercenaries, neuters,</hi> and <hi>enemies;</hi> direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your ſelf in the <hi>action</hi> propounded, either to <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, abide, retreat fight, lodge, refreſh;</hi> according to the <hi>occaſion</hi> which <hi>men, means, munitions, time, works,</hi> and the <hi>countrey</hi> do afford; doing all things according to <hi>reaſon,</hi> which proceedeth from <hi>honour, profite, obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, obligation, neceſſitie</hi> and <hi>facilitie;</hi> uſing the help of <hi>inſtruments</hi> fitting for execution, as <hi>waggons, lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, bridges, pickaxes, ſhovels,</hi> and <hi>boats;</hi> meeting with <hi>accidents</hi> which might befall by <hi>noiſe, ſun, water, cold, duſt,</hi> and <hi>ſmoak;</hi> by the <hi>faſhion</hi> of <hi>order, commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, aſſurance, ſurpriſe, diligence,</hi> and <hi>foreſight.</hi> So that you may make an <hi>encycle</hi> of nine moveable circles (as the figure ſheweth) namely of <hi>queſtions, deliberations, perſons, actions, occaſions, reaſons, inſtruments, acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,</hi> and <hi>faſhions.</hi> Every circle containeth ſix com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon places, the greateſt is called the firſt, and the leaſt the ninth. If you turn the ſecond circle with a whole revolution, upon each common place of the firſt, you
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:23136:111"/> ſhall finde 36 queſtions, as, <hi>Whether you ought to make warre, whether you ought to make peace, whether you ought to make truce, whether you ought to parly, whether you ought to make alliance, whether you ought to make league. With whom you ſhould make warre, with whom you ſhould make peace, with whom you ſhould make truce, with whom you ſhould parly, with whom you ſhould make alliance, with whom you ſhould make league. Where you ſhould make warre, where you ſhould make peace, where you ſhould make truce, where you ſhould parly, where you ſhould make alliance, where you ſhould make league. When you ſhould make warre, when you ſhould make peace, when you ſhould make truce, when you ſhould parly, when you ſhould make alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, when you ſhould make league. How you ſhould make warre, how you ſhould make peace, how you ſhould make truce, how you ſhould parly, how you ſhould make alliance, how you ſhould make league. How much you ſhould make warre, how much you ſhould make peace, how much you ſhould make truce, how much you ſhould parly, how much you ſhould make alliance, how much you ſhould make league.</hi> And if you turn the third circle even as the ſecond, you ſhall finde that the ſaid 36 queſtions being joyned to the ſix common places of the ſaid circle, will produce 216. Namely, <hi>Whether you ſhould make warre with your compatriots, whether you ſhould make peace with your compatriots, whether you ſhould make truce with your compatriots,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe 216 queſtions are reſolved by the common places of the fifth, ſixth and ninth circles.</p>
                  <p>If you have concluded to make warre, the queſtions to be propounded about the <hi>actions</hi> thereof, are to be taken out of the firſt and fourth circles, which will produce 36 propoſitions (as was ſaid of the firſt and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:23136:111"/> ſecond) namely, <hi>Whether you ought to advance for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, whether you ought to abide ſtill, whether you ought to retreat, whether you ought to fight, whether you ought to lodge, whether you ought to refreſh. With whom you ſhould advance, with whom you ſhould abide, with whom you ſhould retreat, with whom you ſhould fight, with whom you ſhould lodge, with whom you ſhould refreſh. Where you ſhould advance,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The affirmation of the 36 laſt propoſitions is taken from the common places of the fifth, ſixth, ſeventh, eighth, and ninth circles. Now, that theſe common places may be ſufficient to afford reaſons for the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of theſe propoſitions, the following example will teſtifie, and will give inſtruction for the order which muſt be obſerved, for the reſolving of other queſtions propounded.</p>
                  <p>The firſt queſtion is, <hi>Whether you ſhould make warre?</hi> whereupon you muſt conſider of the <hi>reaſon</hi> which you have ſo to do; whether it be <hi>honour,</hi> as to conſerve your own, to maintain another, to ſettle ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, to puniſh evill doers. Whether it be <hi>profit,</hi> as to raiſe your ſtate, to augment your dignities, to gather wealth, to advance your friends. Whether it be <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> due to the Soveraigne, or to thoſe which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf or the laws have ſet over us. Whether it be <hi>obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,</hi> being bound thereunto either by equitie, or oath, or conſanguinitie, or alliance. Whether it be <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitie,</hi> as to reſiſt the aſſaults of the enemie, to uſurpe his dominions, and to bring him under ſubjection in ſhort time, and with little charge.</p>
                  <p>Having conſidered of the <hi>reaſon</hi> you muſt come to the <hi>occaſion,</hi> which may be either in reſpect of <hi>men,</hi> which are either plebeians or militarie. Concerning the plebeians (if it be in a free ſtate, and not a monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie)
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:23136:112"/> to know whether they will conſent and approve of the <hi>action,</hi> furniſh men for the warre, deliver places for ſecuritie, money to bear all the charges, and ſubmit themſelves to your judgement and diſcretion. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the militarie men, whether they be willing to obey you, deliver you hoſtages, and put their fortunes, goods, and honours into your hands.</p>
                  <p>Now for the regard of <hi>means,</hi> as whether you have good ſtore of money beforehand, or means to get it, by favour of friends, or to take it from your enemies, making warre at his charge, or having good ſtore of auxiliaries from your allies, and means to pay them.</p>
                  <p>And in reſpect of <hi>munitions,</hi> whether you have abundance of victuall, as well for the proviſion of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as for the feeding of the armies, magazines well ſtored, great ſtore of draught horſes for the ready drawing of the train where it ſhall be needfull.</p>
                  <p>Or in regard of the <hi>time,</hi> whether it be when there is a diſſention, fomenting one of the parties; in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noritie of the Soveraigne, inſinuating with his officers; in the midſt of a profound peace, when there is no doubt of combinations, when a great mortalitie rageth amongſt the enemies, and famine weakneth them; or when you conceive that the fear of warre will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain them to give you more then you could get by it.</p>
                  <p>Or in reſpect of the <hi>works,</hi> whether you poſſeſſe ſtrong cities, aſſured havens, and well fortified citta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels.</p>
                  <p>Or in regard of the <hi>countrey,</hi> whether you poſſeſſe the ſtraits, the key ſides, bridges, that ſo you may fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate the entrance of your releefs, and eaſily to joyn your ſelf to them, and by that means be maſter of the field, poſſeſſing ſo much of the countrey as you are
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:23136:112"/> able to guard, and abandoning that which you could not be able to maintain, and whereof the coſt would ſurpaſſe the profit.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the <hi>faſhion</hi> of proceeding, it is taken from the <hi>order</hi> which you muſt obſerve before you execute any thing; as whether you ought to begin, or to give occaſion to the enemie to do it, in what place you ſhould give the firſt aſſault, in what ſtaple towns; and if it ſhould be ſo, how you ſhall march thither, with what quantitie of Infanterie, Cavallrie, and Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerie you ſhould execute the enterpriſe; whether you be able to do it alone, or whether you muſt call your friends to help you; who (amongſt all) ſhall begin, who ſhall do the exploit, who ſhall conſerve that which ſhall be gotten.</p>
                  <p>Then what commoditie you ſhall reap thereby, whether you ſhall be in peace afterwards, or the nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie be better pleaſed, the church more flouriſhing, juſtice better adminiſtred, the people leſſe burthened, the King better ſerved, the ſtate better ſecured; what <hi>commoditie</hi> will facilitate the enterpriſe, will it be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinitie, will it be the weakneſſe of the enemie, of his countrey, of his people, of his towns, of his bad coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, of his diſorder in his actions, or that you have no want of any thing.</p>
                  <p>What <hi>Aſſurance</hi> have you that the execution will ſucceed according to your deſire; and if that be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, how ſhall you aſſure your affairs; will you hazard all your fortune at a time, will you play at double or quit, or will not that which you undertake be able to hurt you but in part, or but little, or nothing at all, neither to your ſelf nor your friends.</p>
                  <p>Shall you <hi>ſurpriſe</hi> your enem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:23136:113"/> field, at a time when he is ſolacing himſelf either with courting or hunting, and without being able to be advertiſed of your deſigne, untill he be fallen into your hands?</p>
                  <p>Can you by your <hi>diligence</hi> prevent his knowledge, and ſo your own obſtacles and his remedies?</p>
                  <p>Have you <hi>foreſeen</hi> whatſoever may befall you, as well in your deſigne, in the action, and after the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, to prevent the miſchief, and to advantage your ſelf by the good thereof? will your confederates be faithfull to you? If falſe, ſhall they be able to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the enterpriſe in the whole or onely in part, or in your very perſon, by ſeizing thereon and delivering you into the enemies hands? and if they can, by what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice ſhall you be able to eſcape them? If the things aboveſaid be ſo advantageous as you ought to conclude for warre, you muſt then come to the other queſtion, <hi>with whom you ought to make it,</hi> whether with your <hi>compatriots,</hi> or with your <hi>allies,</hi> or <hi>confederates,</hi> &amp;c. and to ſee the <hi>reaſon,</hi> the <hi>occaſion,</hi> and <hi>faſhion</hi> by which you ſhould proceed, paſſing through all theſe common places.</p>
                  <p>That done, you muſt handle the queſtions which concern the <hi>action,</hi> which are, <hi>whether or no, with whom, where, when, how,</hi> and <hi>how much</hi> you ſhall do that which you have concluded (as hath been ſhewed in the firſt queſtion:) as if a generall had cauſed his armie to be muſtered, he ſhall deliberate wherein to imploy it, as <hi>whether</hi> he ſhould cauſe it to <hi>advance,</hi> or <hi>abide,</hi> or <hi>fight,</hi> &amp;c. Suppoſe <hi>if be ought to cauſe his armie to march,</hi> he ought to do it when it is to fight with the enemie, to hinder him from paſſing a cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pain, a river, a ſtrait, to cut off his releef; or for his own effecting of theſe things, or to beſiege ſome place,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:23136:113"/> to releeve it, to cut off a convoy, or to conſerve, or pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage the open countrey.</p>
                  <p>You muſt <hi>advance,</hi> when your <hi>abiding</hi> or <hi>retreat</hi> would be diſhonourable, when the hope of the <hi>profit</hi> is great, when ſuperiours <hi>command</hi> it, when alliance <hi>oblige</hi> you to it, when <hi>neceſſitie</hi> conſtrains you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, and when the thing is ſo <hi>facile</hi> as nothing can op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you.</p>
                  <p>That which will <hi>occaſion</hi> your moving, will be the advantage of <hi>men,</hi> be it on foot or horſeback; of <hi>means,</hi> as money, waggons, artillerie; of <hi>munitions</hi> both for the mouth and for warre; the commodiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of <hi>time,</hi> fair, cold, or rain. Of the <hi>works,</hi> as forts, trenches, redouts. Of the <hi>countrey,</hi> as large, ſpacious, and even, to range your battaillons and ſquadrons; or cloſe and mountainous, to paſſe undiſcovered and ſheltred. The <hi>inſtruments</hi> which may facilitate the deſigne, are <hi>waggons</hi> to carrie the munitions; <hi>ladders</hi> to ſerve for ſurpriſes; <hi>bridges</hi> to paſſe over moats and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, <hi>pickaxes</hi> and <hi>ſhovels</hi> to make the trenches and other works, and <hi>boats</hi> to paſſe rivers. The <hi>accidents</hi> which you ought to foreſee, are the <hi>noiſe</hi> which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth the ſouldiers from hearing the orders, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighteth them; the <hi>ſunne,</hi> which may dazle them; the <hi>water</hi> of pools, moors or rain, which may diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mode you; the <hi>cold,</hi> which may put your ſouldiers out of caſe to fight; the <hi>duſt</hi> raiſed in the field by the footing; and the <hi>ſmoak</hi> of firings, which hinders you from ſeeing the battaillons, and the actions of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie. After that, you muſt conſider the <hi>faſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:23136:114"/> it in the whole or in part. Wherein your <hi>aſſurance</hi> will be, whether in your enemies being farre off, or in the ſtrength of your ſite, or of the territorie, or vicinitie of friends; whether you muſt march upon <hi>ſurpriſe</hi> in the night, to pillage; with ſuch <hi>diligence</hi> as you may be farre before you be diſcovered; <hi>foreſeeing</hi> for all things neceſſarie, as to be able to make reſiſtance, being charged; to arrive timely, before the danger; to be ſtrongly and commodiouſly encamped, in ſuch ſort as you may not fear neither the ſurpriſes of the enemie, nor the violence of his aſſaults.</p>
                  <p>Theſe common places may be applied as well to divers other actions as to that of warre, provided that you know which to chooſe, and how many.</p>
